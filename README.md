# Youtube Chrome Controller

Soon there will be Google Chrome extension and Windows application, wich lets you to control player on youtube.com (even through clicking on app tray icon).

*I created this simply for listening music playlists on youtube and easy controlling player over windows tray.
It was very uncomfortable to find chrome and the youtube tab when i wanted to pause song or change to another.*
