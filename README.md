# Youtube Chrome Controller

Youtube controller consists of Google Chrome extension and Windows application, wich lets you to control player on youtube.com directly from Windows (even Play/Pause through clicking on app tray icon).

*I created this simply for listening music playlists on youtube and easy controlling player over windows tray.
It was very uncomfortable to find chrome and the youtube tab when i wanted to pause or resume song.*
